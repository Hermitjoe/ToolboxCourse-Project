# The Data Scientist’s Toolbox Project

The assignment is outlined as: 
  "This easy project is your chance to demonstrate that you’ve done the basic software setup 
 (*R*, *RStudio*, and *GitHub*) that will get you through the rest of the Data Science Specialization."

## Course Overview
This course was aimed at giving direction to students to setup tools that can be used for **data science**.
These tools will assist a student with completing the "*Data Science Specialization*" prepared by John Hopkins University.

## Project outline
Created the *GitHub* repo for this project: [Project Repo]( https://github.com/Hermitjoe/ToolboxCourse-Project)
Second created an *RStudio* Project and connected the project to the repository.
After connecting to the repository, a new project was created to facilitate the **R Markdown** Document.

### I feel these steps should be enough to meet the projects outline.
